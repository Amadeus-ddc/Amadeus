[conv-41] Q: What event did John volunteer at last weekend?
Category: 4
GT: career fair at a local school
Pred: it seems likely that John volunteered at a homeless shelter last weekend. However, there is no explicit mention of John volunteering specifically at a homeless shelter last weekend. The closest information is that he has been involved in various volunteer activities and that Maria, who is also mentioned, volunteers at a homeless shelter. Given this context, the most reasonable inference is that John might have volunteered at a homeless shelter last weekend, but without direct evidence, we cannot be certain.
