[conv-26] Q: What did Caroline take away from the book "Becoming Nicole"?
Category: 4
GT: Lessons on self-acceptance and finding support
Pred: From the information provided, it seems that Caroline was inspired by the book "Becoming Nicole," which likely reinforced her courage and acceptance of her own identity, similar to how the song "Brave" by Sara Bareilles resonates with her. However, specific details about what Caroline took away from the book are not explicitly stated. Given the context of her journey and her involvement in the LGBTQ+ community, it is reasonable to infer that the book may have provided her with additional insights, validation, and support for her own transgender experience.
