GT: Pomodoro technique
Pred: The information provided indicates that Tim uses the study method of breaking tasks into smaller parts to prepare for exams. Therefore, the popular time management technique Tim uses is likely the Pomodoro Technique or a similar method involving breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. However, since the exact name of the technique isn't specified, we can infer that Tim divides his study sessions into manageable segments to handle his busy exam period effectively.

Pred: Tim plans to visit Universal Studios, which has locations in Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, California. Since there is no specific mention of which location Tim intends to visit, we can infer that he might be in either Florida or California during September 2023. Given his excitement for the Harry Potter stuff at Universal Studios, it is likely he would choose one of these two locations. Therefore, the US states Tim might be in during September 2023 are Florida and California.

Pred: John started surfing five years ago and finds exploring new places to be inspiring and fun. While there isn't direct information about how he feels specifically while surfing, we can infer that he likely enjoys it given his positive attitude towards new experiences and activities. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that John feels positive emotions such as enjoyment, excitement, and relaxation while surfing.
