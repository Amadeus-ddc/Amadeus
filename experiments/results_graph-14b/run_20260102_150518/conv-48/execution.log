Category: 2
GT: Wednesday before 9 February, 2023
Pred: Jolene planned to attend a meditation retreat near a lake on 2023-09-06, which seems to align with the idea of a mini-retreat to reflect on her career. However, there is no specific mention of a "mini-retreat" explicitly stated for career reflection. The closest match is the meditation retreat mentioned, which could serve a similar purpose of reflection and rejuvenation. Therefore, the most likely answer is that Jolene had a mini-retreat to reflect on her career around **September 6, 2023**.
