GT: excited
Pred: Given the context that Jon expresses passion, dedication, and determination towards his dance studio, and considering his statement "Seeing my students succeed motivates me," it can be inferred that Jon likely feels excited and proud about the opening night of his dance studio. However, since there's no direct mention of his feelings specifically towards the opening night, we can only make an educated guess based on his previous sentiments. Therefore, the best possible answer is:
