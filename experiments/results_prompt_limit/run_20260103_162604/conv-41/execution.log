Q: How does your family's support compare to the support you receive from your friends? Are there any differences in the types of support each group provides?
GT: Comparison between family and friend support.
Pred: Based on the available information, it seems that both family and friends provide support, though the specific details about the types of support from friends are not provided. The context shows that family members, specifically John and Maria, support each other and spread positivity through activities like family road trips and boot camps. They also encourage each other in their endeavors. While there is no direct comparison made between family and friend support, the support from family appears to be consistent and long-term, involving shared experiences and mutual encouragement. Without more specific information about the support from friends, it's challenging to draw a direct comparison. Therefore, the answer is:

Family support seems to be consistent and involves shared experiences and mutual encouragement, while friend support is not explicitly detailed in the given context.
