Q: How does the appearance of your words on the big screen make you feel compared to when you first started writing the screenplay?
GT: Joanna might reflect on her feelings and growth as a writer since starting the screenplay process.
Pred: Joanna felt a mix of emotions, including relief, excitement, and anxiety, after finishing her first full screenplay. When her screenplay appeared on the big screen, she would likely experience a heightened sense of accomplishment, joy, and possibly even nervousness or pride. The transition from writing the screenplay to seeing it realized on the big screen represents a significant milestone in her career as a screenwriter, which would amplify these feelings. Therefore, compared to when she first started writing the screenplay, the appearance of her words on the big screen would make her feel more accomplished and proud, though still with some anxiety about how well-received it might be.
