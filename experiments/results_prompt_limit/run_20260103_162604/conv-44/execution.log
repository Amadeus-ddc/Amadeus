Q: Are there any specific toys or treats that your dogs enjoy playing with or eating in the backyard, and how do you manage these items to prevent them from being left unattended?
GT: The conversation does not mention any specific toys or treats, but this could be an important aspect of managing the dogs' environment.
Pred: Based on the available information, Audrey has set up a doggy play area with agility stuff and toys in the backyard. It is likely that her dogs enjoy playing with these toys. However, there is no specific mention of particular toys or treats they enjoy.

Q: Given the increased space in the backyard, have you thought about introducing any new training exercises or activities for your dogs to keep them mentally stimulated?
GT: While the conversation indicates the dogs are enjoying the space, it doesn't mention any planned training or enrichment activities.
Pred: Given the information that the dogs enjoy going on hikes and playing fetch, it's reasonable to infer that introducing new training exercises or activities in the backyard could include additional games or training methods to keep them mentally stimulated. For example, the owner might consider training exercises like hide-and-seek with treats, obstacle courses, or even teaching new tricks. However, without explicit information about current plans, the best possible answer is:

Introducing new training exercises or activities in the backyard could be a good idea to keep the dogs mentally stimulated. Possible options might include hide-and-seek with treats, obstacle courses, or teaching new tricks.
