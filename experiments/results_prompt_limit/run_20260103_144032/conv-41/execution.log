Q: Can you tell me about one of the most challenging parts of the hiking trip and how you and your workmates overcame it together?
GT: Discussing a specific challenge and how teamwork helped overcome it could reveal more about the dynamics within the group and potentially uncover emotional or psychological vulnerabilities.
Pred: One of the most challenging parts of the hiking trip was navigating through a steep and rocky section of the trail.
