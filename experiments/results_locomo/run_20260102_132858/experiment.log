[conv-30] Q: What Jon thinks the ideal dance studio should look like?
Category: 1
GT: By the water, with natural light and Marley flooring
Pred: Based on Jon's passion and experiences, the ideal dance studio he envisions would likely be a creative space that supports contemporary dance, a style he is particularly passionate about. He dreams of having a place where dancers can express themselves freely, similar to his own dance crew's success. The studio would ideally have Marley flooring for the dance floor, and he is actively searching for the perfect location. Additionally, Jon aims to create a supportive environment where he can mentor and train aspiring dancers, much like his own journey from dancer to entrepreneur.
