Q: How does John's yoga practice influence his choice of classes at the new studio?
GT: He has tried weight training as well, finding it challenging but peaceful, similar to yoga.
Pred: John's yoga practice seems to influence his choice of classes at the new studio by focusing on the fundamentals of yoga such as poses and breathing. This suggests that John prefers classes that help him deepen his understanding and practice of yoga, which might include more traditional yoga classes rather than specialized or less fundamental classes. However, without direct evidence linking his yoga practice specifically to choosing certain classes over others, we can only infer that his interest in yoga fundamentals likely guides his class selection.
