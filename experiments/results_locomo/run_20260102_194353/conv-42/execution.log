GT: Won a video game tournament
Pred: Nate likely spent time cooking and experimenting with dairy-free dessert recipes while Joanna was on her road trip. This inference is drawn from the fact that Nate is interested in dairy-free desserts and has shared recipes with Joanna multiple times. Given their close relationship and mutual interests, it seems natural that Nate would continue to engage in such activities during Joanna's absence.
