Pred: Jolene and Deborah spent time in Rio de Janeiro, and Jolene got back from a trip to Rio de Janeiro where she checked out cool yoga classes and visited many cafes. While there is no explicit mention of what they did specifically, given their interest in yoga and their relationship, it is reasonable to infer that they likely practiced yoga together in Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, a plausible answer to the question "What was Jolene doing with her partner in Rio de Janeiro?" is:

Jolene was practicing yoga with her partner Deborah in Rio de Janeiro.
