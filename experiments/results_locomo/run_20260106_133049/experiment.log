For example, 'What game did Nate mention winning his first tournament with during your recent conversation?' This will help ensure that the Questioner is not relying solely on historical information and is engaging with the most recent and relevant data.

Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log shows that Joanna has a preference for Romantic Dramas and has watched such movies multiple times. It also mentions that Joanna appreciates the theme of memory and relationships in these movies. However, there is no direct link indicating that Joanna recommended a specific movie to Nate. Step 3: Deciding the blame. Since the exact recommendation is not explicitly linked in the log, the blame lies with the Answerer for not retrieving this specific piece of information.

The prediction states that Joanna has severe allergies to most reptiles and animals with fur, which makes Nate's recommendation of having a pet turtle for stress relief unsuitable for her. This aligns with the ground truth, which mentions Joanna's severe allergies to most reptiles and animals with fur. However, the prediction does not explicitly mention the reason for the recommendation (stress relief) or the applicability of the advice to Joanna given her allergies. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log correctly captures Joanna's severe allergies to most reptiles and animals with fur. However, there is no link indicating the recommendation of pets for stress relief or any mention of Nate's reasoning behind the recommendation. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is correct in terms of the allergy information but lacks context about the recommendation and its applicability, the blame lies with the Builder for not capturing the relevant context.

Her recent completion of her first full screenplay and her plans to submit it to film festivals indicate a strong passion for writing. The mix of drama and romance in her work suggests she might be drawn to genres like Dramas and Romantic Dramas, which could influence her creative direction. Additionally, her current emotional state and the recommendation of 'Little Women' imply that she values memory and relationships, which could shape her storytelling approach. Despite her severe allergies, her consideration of getting pets despite these allergies shows her resilience and adaptability, traits that could also play a role in her career choices."}
2026-01-06 13:31:24,745 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction includes the correct emotions (relief, excitement, and worry) but adds an extra detail (planning to submit to film festivals) which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. However, the core information is correct. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log correctly captures the relationship between Joanna and her screenplay, including her mixed emotions. There is no missing information related to the current emotional state. Step 3: Deciding. Since the core information is correct and the prediction aligns with the ground truth, the prediction can be considered correct despite the additional detail.

2026-01-06 13:31:25,612 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction states that Joanna's favorite movie genres are Sci-Fi Movies and Action Movies, while the ground truth indicates that Joanna only recommended 'Little Women', which is a drama. This suggests an incorrect prediction. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log does not contain any information about Joanna's favorite movie genres. The closest related information is her recommendation of 'Little Women', which is a drama. Step 3: Deciding based on the blame logic. Since the specific relationship or attribute needed to answer the question is absent from the log, the blame lies with the BUILDER.

2026-01-06 13:31:26,509 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction provides a detailed analysis of Joanna's emotions and their potential long-term impact on her career decisions. However, the ground truth states that it's not explicitly stated how her emotions will affect her career decisions. This suggests that while the prediction is plausible, it goes beyond the information provided in the text buffer. Therefore, the prediction is considered correct based on the rule that a specific, plausible fact from history can be considered correct even if it's not explicitly stated in the ground truth. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log does not contain any direct information about how Joanna's emotions might affect her career decisions. The log focuses on her recent activities and hobbies, which do not directly link to her emotional state and its impact on her career. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible and the ground truth allows for a broader interpretation, we conclude that the prediction is correct. However, the question asked by the Questioner could have been more focused on extracting explicit information from the given context.

2026-01-06 13:31:59,369 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction with the Ground Truth, the prediction states that Nate is participating in a video game tournament where he played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. However, the ground truth indicates that there is no explicit mention of any game Nate is playing in the tournament. This suggests that the prediction is incorrect. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, we see that the log mentions Nate participating in a video game tournament but does not specify which game he is playing. Therefore, the information about Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not present in the log. This means the blame lies with the BUILDER for not capturing the specific game Nate is playing. Step 3: Deciding based on the above analysis, the prediction is incorrect due to the Builder's failure to capture the specific game Nate is playing.

The log shows that there are no direct links related to Joanna's love for nature and its impact on her writing. The closest link is the general mention of nature, but it is not explicitly tied to her writing process. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is correct and plausible, but the specific context provided by the question is not strongly represented in the graph, we can conclude that the blame lies with the BUILDER for not capturing the relevant connections.

Joanna's enjoyment of baking dairy-free desserts could indeed inspire her creativity in screenplay writing, especially given her current focus on dairy-free dessert recipes and her love for cooking and baking as creative outlets. However, the prediction provides more specific details than the ground truth, which suggests that the prediction is an extrapolation based on the available information rather than a direct match. Given that the prediction is plausible and the ground truth does not explicitly state that Joanna's enjoyment of baking will directly influence her screenplay writing, we can consider the prediction correct. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, we find that the log captures Joanna's current focus on dairy-free dessert recipes and her love for cooking and baking. There is no direct link between Joanna's baking activities and her screenplay writing process.

The ground truth states that Nate went to meet new people and discuss gaming tips after his video game tournament, while the prediction does not provide any information. This suggests that the information is missing from the global memory graph, indicating a potential issue with the Builder's activity log. Step 2: Analyzing the Log - The log shows that Nate met new people at the tournament, which is relevant to the question. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific action of discussing gaming tips or meeting new people post-tournament. This indicates that the Builder might have missed capturing the exact relationship or context needed to answer the question correctly. Step 3: Deciding - Given that the specific relationship needed to answer the question is absent from the log, the blame lies with the Builder.

The ground truth suggests Joanna might continue working on her screenplay and seek support from friends, while the prediction includes activities like cooking dairy-free desserts, watching movies, and playing video games, which are not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, these activities could be inferred as part of her emotional coping mechanism. Given the context, the prediction is plausible but not entirely accurate. Step 2: Analyzing Log - The log shows that Nate's recent activities are more focused on gaming and organizing a party, which are not directly related to Joanna's emotional state post-rejection. The log does not capture Joanna's immediate emotional response or her potential coping mechanisms.

2026-01-06 13:34:11,145 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction provides a detailed and plausible explanation of Joanna's feelings towards Nate, which aligns well with the ground truth. However, the prediction goes beyond the immediate context provided in the text buffer, focusing more on the symbolic meaning of the Iron Man figure rather than the direct support and encouragement mentioned in the conversation. This suggests that while the prediction is plausible, it might be overly interpretative based on the given information. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log shows that the Builder has captured the relevant information about Joanna's screenplay and Nate's Iron Man figure. However, the prediction seems to have missed the direct support and encouragement aspect, which is more explicitly stated in the conversation. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible but slightly misses the direct support aspect, the blame lies with the Answerer for not fully capturing the explicit support mentioned in the conversation.

The prediction aligns well with the ground truth, suggesting that the family photo serves as a source of inspiration and comfort, reminding Joanna of the support and love from her family. This is consistent with the provided context where Joanna mentions the importance of family support during her creative process and career decisions. Step 2: Analyzing the Log, we see that the Builder has captured the relevant information about the family photo and its significance. The log includes links such as 'Joanna --Reminds of family support--> Cork Board' and 'Joanna --Hanging on cork board--> Family Picture'. There is no missing relationship or attribute that would cause the Answerer to fail. Step 3: Given that the prediction is correct and the Builder has captured the necessary information, there is no need to blame either the Builder or the Answerer.

The prediction goes into more detail about specific superheroes and shared activities, which is not necessary for answering the question. However, the core idea aligns with the ground truth, making the prediction correct in essence. Step 2: Analyzing the Log.

The prediction states that Joanna submitted her recent screenplay to a film contest, which matches the ground truth. Therefore, the prediction is correct. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log shows that the information about Joanna submitting her screenplay is not present. However, the prediction is correct because the information is plausible and aligns with the context provided. Step 3: Deciding that the prediction is correct, and since the information is plausible and the log does not contradict it, the blame lies with the Questioner for asking about recent events when the conversation context is more focused on past activities.

2026-01-06 13:34:23,678 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction provides a detailed and plausible explanation of how Joanna's recent submission of her screenplay might affect her confidence. However, the ground truth is more concise and focuses on the potential boost in confidence due to seeking feedback. The prediction is more detailed and includes additional context, which makes it seem overly specific compared to the ground truth. This suggests that the prediction is correct in its core idea but might be too detailed given the available information. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log shows that the relationship between Joanna and Nate is supportive, but there is no direct mention of Joanna's recent screenplay submission or its impact on her confidence. The log captures general support and interactions but lacks the specific detail needed to predict the impact of the screenplay submission. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible and aligns with the ground truth, we can consider it correct. However, the prediction is more detailed than necessary based on the available information.

2026-01-06 13:34:23,678 - Amadeus.Agent - INFO - 📈 Guideline Updated for [GENERATE]: Focus on extracting and presenting the most relevant and concise information. Avoid asking for overly detailed predictions unless the context clearly supports such specificity. Encourage questions that focus on the immediate context and relationships rather than broader implications without clear evidence.
2026-01-06 13:34:23,712 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction with the Ground Truth, we see that the prediction is plausible but incorrect. The ground truth states that Nate shared the recipe to give it to Joanna for her family, while the prediction suggests he shared it to support and encourage her in her culinary experiments. This discrepancy indicates a misinterpretation of the context provided by the log.

Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, we find that the log does not contain any information about Joanna's family or the reason behind sharing the recipe specifically for them. Instead, the log focuses on the supportive nature of their interactions and the gaming party. The log does not capture the specific context of sharing the recipe for Joanna's family.

Step 3: Deciding based on the blame logic, since the specific relationship or attribute needed to answer the question (the reason for sharing the recipe for Joanna's family) is absent from the log, the blame lies with the BUILDER.

2026-01-06 13:34:56,092 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the prediction and ground truth, we see that the prediction is partially correct but lacks specificity regarding Nate's teaching of dairy-free desserts. The ground truth states that Joanna thinks Nate's teaching is fun and rewarding, and she appreciates him sharing his passion for dairy-free desserts. The prediction mentions Joanna appreciating Nate's encouragement and support in her culinary endeavors, which includes dairy-free desserts. However, it does not explicitly mention the fun and rewarding aspect of Nate's teaching, nor does it directly state that Joanna appreciates his sharing of passion for dairy-free desserts. This suggests a gap in the information retrieval process. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, we find that there is no direct link between Joanna's appreciation of Nate's teaching and the context of dairy-free desserts. The log mentions that Joanna received a recipe for coconut milk ice cream from Nate and plans to surprise her family with it, but it does not explicitly state that Joanna thinks Nate's teaching is fun and rewarding. Therefore, the blame lies with the Answerer for not retrieving the specific information needed to form the correct prediction. Step 3: Deciding based on the above analysis, the prediction is incorrect due to the Answerer's failure to retrieve the specific information from the Builder Log.

However, since the ground truth only mentions a video game tournament without specifying the game, the prediction is not entirely wrong but rather an assumption based on common knowledge.

The ground truth only mentions chocolate, raspberry, and coconut flavored desserts without specifying the exact types of desserts. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, we find that the log captures Joanna's intention to make desserts more accessible and mentions specific types of desserts like chocolate coconut cupcakes and cookies. However, the log does not explicitly mention the exact flavors (chocolate, raspberry, and coconut).

This shared interest provides a common ground for them to bond over, share experiences, and offer encouragement. For instance, Nate shared a vegan ice cream recipe with Joanna, which she plans to try and share with her family. This exchange of recipes and support in the kitchen suggests that their shared interest in dairy-free desserts contributes to their emotional support and strengthens their relationship."}

Her approach to using technology in her writing career might become more focused and driven, as she seeks ways to overcome her current challenges and maintain her creative flow."}
2026-01-06 13:35:48,325 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction is quite detailed and plausible, suggesting that Joanna and Nate's shared interest in dairy-free desserts strengthens their mutual support and understanding. However, the ground truth provided is more general and focuses on the potential strengthening of their bond and mutual support rather than specific examples of shared recipes or support in the kitchen. The prediction is plausible but not entirely aligned with the ground truth. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log shows that both Joanna and Nate have interests in dairy-free desserts, and there is a specific link showing that Nate shared a vegan ice cream recipe with Joanna. This information supports the prediction to some extent. However, the log does not explicitly mention how this shared interest affects their relationship or mutual support in their respective fields. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible and supported by the log, but the ground truth is more general, we can conclude that the prediction is correct. The blame lies with the Questioner for asking a question that requires more context and specific details.

2026-01-06 13:35:48,325 - Amadeus.Agent - INFO - 📈 Guideline Updated for [GENERATE]: The Questioner should focus on asking more specific and context-driven questions that require the system to provide detailed interactions and impacts of shared interests on relationships and professional support. Questions should encourage the system to draw connections between personal interests and professional collaborations.
2026-01-06 13:35:48,437 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction suggests that Nate's cooking show experience might influence Joanna to explore further in her writing career by encouraging her to write about dairy-free desserts and other vegan recipes. However, the ground truth states that Joanna might consider incorporating more sensory descriptions or food-related themes in her writing, inspired by Nate’s passion for cooking. This indicates a mismatch between the prediction and the ground truth. Step 2: Analyzing Log - The Builder Log shows that there are several links related to Joanna's interest in dairy-free desserts and her support for Nate's sharing of vegan ice cream recipes. However, there is no direct link indicating that Nate's cooking show experience specifically influenced Joanna to write about sensory descriptions or food-related themes. Step 3: Deciding - Given that the prediction is incorrect and the Builder Log does not provide the necessary information to support the prediction, the blame lies with the BUILDER.

2026-01-06 13:35:48,437 - Amadeus.Agent - INFO - 📈 Guideline Updated for [UPDATE]: Update the Builder's extraction rules to ensure that it captures indirect influences and thematic inspirations from shared experiences.

2026-01-06 13:35:50,450 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction with the Ground Truth. The prediction provides a detailed emotional and behavioral response to the loss of work, which is not aligned with the ground truth. The ground truth suggests Joanna might become more cautious and diligent about backing up her work, while the prediction focuses on emotional vulnerability and reliance on technology as a therapeutic outlet. This indicates a mismatch between the predicted and actual outcomes based on the provided context.

Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log does not contain any direct information about Joanna's emotional state or her approach to using technology post-loss. The log primarily focuses on Joanna's interest in cooking and baking, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, the Builder missed capturing the relevant information.

Step 3: Deciding the blame. Since the specific relationship or attribute needed to answer the question (Joanna's emotional state and its impact on her technology usage) is absent from the Builder Log, the blame lies with the BUILDER.

2026-01-06 13:36:06,656 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction suggests Joanna's favorite movie genres are Dramas and Romantic Dramas, with a possible interest in Sci-Fi. However, the ground truth indicates that Joanna's favorite genre is based on her interest in 'Little Women,' which suggests she might prefer dramas or adaptations. This prediction is plausible but not entirely accurate based on the given context. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log does not mention any specific movie preferences or discussions about Joanna's favorite genres. The log focuses more on Joanna's work on dairy-free recipes and her interaction with Nate. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible but not entirely accurate, and the log does not provide specific information about Joanna's movie preferences, we can conclude that the prediction is correct, albeit incomplete.

The ground truth focuses more on the supportive conversation and the inspiration derived from it, without explicitly mentioning these additional details. Step 2: Analyzing the Log.

However, based on the context, it is plausible that they discussed these interests during their conversation. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, there is no direct link between Nate and Joanna discussing gaming or writing. The log shows that both Nate and Joanna have interests in gaming, but there is no explicit mention of them sharing this interest. Step 3: Deciding, the blame lies with the BUILDER because the specific relationship or attribute needed to answer the question (i.e., the shared interest in gaming and writing) is absent from the log.

The ground truth focuses on Nate meeting new people and how this relates to Joanna's encouragement to step outside her comfort zone. The prediction includes details about video games, movies, and shared hobbies, which are not relevant to the specific question asked. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, there is no direct link between Nate's experience at the game convention and Joanna's encouragement to find new experiences. The log captures individual activities but does not establish the connection between these activities and the encouragement provided by Joanna. Step 3: Deciding, the blame lies with the BUILDER because the necessary relationship or attribute (the connection between Nate's experience and Joanna's encouragement) is absent from the log.

2026-01-06 13:36:29,475 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction provides a detailed comparison between Joanna's and Nate's approaches to managing stress, which aligns well with the ground truth. However, the prediction includes information about specific games and movies that were not directly relevant to the question asked. The ground truth focuses on the general methods of managing stress through writing and gaming, without delving into specific titles. Therefore, the prediction is mostly correct but could be more concise and relevant to the question. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log shows that both Nate and Joanna have interests in gaming and movies, but there is no direct mention of how their hobbies influence their stress management techniques. The log does not capture the specific relationship between their hobbies and stress management. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is mostly correct but could be more focused, and the log does not provide the necessary context, the blame lies with the BUILDER for not capturing the relevant information.

2026-01-06 13:36:48,481 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction and Ground Truth. The prediction aligns well with the ground truth, suggesting that Nate's turtles provide emotional support, which positively impacts his performance in tournaments. This is a plausible and accurate interpretation based on the context provided. However, the question specifically asks about the relationship between his interest in turtles and his performance in video game tournaments, which requires a more direct link that might be missing in the current log. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log captures the emotional support provided by the turtles but does not explicitly link this to his performance in video game tournaments. The log mentions that the turtles cheer him up and help him relieve stress, but it does not directly state how this affects his tournament performance. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is correct and plausible, the issue lies in the question's specificity rather than a failure in the system.

This is incorrect compared to the ground truth, which states that Joanna named Tilly because she used to have a dog back in Michigan with that name, but then she got allergic and had to get rid of her. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log does not contain any information about Tilly being a gift from Nate or the stuffed animal being named after a dog.

This will help in maintaining accuracy and preventing unnecessary elaborations.
2026-01-06 13:37:09,798 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction with the Ground Truth, the prediction is incorrect because the provided ground truth states that Nate finds joy and companionship in taking care of his turtles, which he has loved since childhood. However, the prediction elaborates on how Nate's emotional state influenced his hobbies and social interactions, which is not directly supported by the given context. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log, there is no direct link between Nate's emotional state and his hobbies or social interactions. The log mentions that Nate takes care of his turtles, but it does not explicitly state how this influences his hobbies or social life. Therefore, the blame lies with the Builder for not capturing the relationship between Nate's turtle care and its impact on his hobbies and social interactions. Step 3: Deciding that the Builder is responsible for the error, as the necessary information was not included in the log.

The prediction states that Joanna discussed her hobbies and interests, which is incorrect based on the ground truth. The ground truth mentions that she discussed her script and its elements of self-discovery. This indicates a mismatch between the prediction and the actual context provided by the text buffer. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log does not contain any direct link to Joanna's script or the discussion points from the meetings. Instead, it focuses on other topics like writing, desserts, and support. This suggests that the Builder missed capturing the relevant information from the conversation. Step 3: Deciding the blame.

2026-01-06 13:37:31,595 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing the Prediction with the Ground Truth. The prediction states that Joanna and Nate planned to share dairy-free ice cream, specifically coconut milk ice cream. However, the ground truth indicates that Nate made a lactose-free dessert with coconut milk, and Joanna brought some of her recipes. This suggests that the prediction is incorrect because it does not match the exact details provided in the ground truth. The prediction is plausible but not entirely accurate based on the given information.

Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log shows that both Joanna and Nate have relevant information about lactose-free desserts, particularly coconut milk ice cream. However, the log does not explicitly mention that they planned to share these desserts together. The log entries suggest that each person had their own plans related to lactose-free desserts, but there is no direct link indicating a shared plan.

Step 3: Deciding the Blame. Since the exact plan to share desserts is not captured in the log, the blame lies with the Builder for not capturing the shared intention. The Answerer did not hallucinate or say 'Unknown,' but the information needed to make the correct prediction was not present in the log.

The prediction provides a detailed account of Joanna's confidence boost after pitching her screenplay, while the ground truth simply states 'It gave her a big confidence boost.' The prediction is more detailed and plausible, but the ground truth is more concise.

Since the ground truth is the definitive source, we need to consider why the prediction diverged from it. Step 2: Analyzing the Builder Log. There are no recent graph updates, indicating that the information about Joanna's screenplay pitch and its impact on her confidence is not present in the current memory graph. This suggests that the Builder missed capturing this information. Step 3: Deciding that the blame lies with the BUILDER for failing to capture the relevant information.

The prediction provides a detailed explanation of Joanna's excitement based on her previous experiences writing the script, which aligns well with the ground truth. However, the prediction goes beyond the immediate context provided in the text buffer, focusing on themes and emotions rather than the direct connection between writing and filming. This suggests that while the prediction is plausible, it might be overly broad given the specific context of the conversation. Step 2: Analyzing the Log. The log does not contain any direct links between Joanna's excitement about filming and her previous experiences writing the script. The log entries are mostly about Joanna's current feelings and activities related to the movie, without explicitly mentioning the connection to her writing process. Step 3: Deciding. Given that the prediction is plausible but somewhat broad, and there is no direct link in the log, we can consider this a correct prediction. However, the question could be more focused on the immediate context.
