GT: Yes; it's classical music
Pred: Melanie enjoys both classical music (Bach, Mozart) and modern music (Ed Sheeran's 'Perfect'). While 'The Four Seasons' by Vivaldi is a classical piece, it is not specified whether Melanie has a particular preference for it. However, given her appreciation for classical music, it is reasonable to assume that she would likely enjoy 'The Four Seasons'. Therefore, it is probable that Melanie would enjoy the song 'The Four Seasons' by Vivaldi.
