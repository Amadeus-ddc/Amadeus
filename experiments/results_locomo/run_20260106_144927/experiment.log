The prediction is correct in terms of the core values of the necklace (love, faith, and strength) and their potential influence on Caroline's career choice. However, the specific mention of 'counseling or mental health work, particularly for trans people' is not directly supported by the provided ground truth. The ground truth states that the necklace influences her career choice by aligning with her desire to help others, but it does not specify the exact field or focus on trans individuals. Step 2/3: Blaming QUESTIONER. The question asks for a specific influence on her career choice, which is more detailed than the provided ground truth.

The prediction attributes her motivation to her personal journey and support received, which is not aligned with the ground truth. Step 2/3: Analyzing the Builder Log, we see that the log contains information about Caroline's personal journey and support received, but it lacks the specific motivation related to seeing the impact of counseling on her life and wanting to create a safe space for trans individuals.

The prediction introduces new elements that are not present in the ground truth or the text buffer. Step 2/3: Blaming QUESTIONER. The question asks about Melanie's emotions while reflecting on her wedding day, which is not mentioned in the provided text buffer. Step 4: Strategy - The question is too broad and does not align with the available information. The system should generate a more discriminative question that focuses on the events and emotions mentioned in the text buffer.

2026-01-06 14:50:57,410 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction provided a detailed comparison between the pride parade and the wedding day, which is plausible but not aligned with the ground truth. The ground truth states that both events were emotionally significant but focuses on the pride parade offering a sense of belonging and community, while the wedding highlighted personal and familial joy. The prediction, however, elaborates on the pride parade's community aspect and the wedding's personal fulfillment, which is more detailed than necessary given the ground truth. This suggests that the prediction is correct in its core but overly detailed, which might be due to the builder's focus on specific details rather than the broader emotional impact. Step 2/3: Blaming - Since the prediction aligns with the ground truth in terms of emotional significance, the blame lies with the QUESTIONER for asking a question that required a more nuanced and specific comparison rather than a general emotional impact. Step 4: Strategy - The questioner should be encouraged to ask more discriminative and context-specific questions to elicit the precise emotional nuances.

2026-01-06 14:51:32,280 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction provided a plausible but not explicitly mentioned story, which aligns with the context of support groups and personal growth. However, the ground truth states that the specific stories or experiences at the support group were not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the prediction is considered correct based on the rules provided. Step 2/3: Since the prediction is correct, we blame the QUESTIONER for asking about specific details that were not present in the buffer context. Step 4: Strategy - To improve, the Questioner should focus on asking more open-ended questions that allow for broader interpretations and less reliance on specific, unmentioned details.

The concert was described as amazing with a lot of love and support, but the specific emotional impact was not detailed. The ground truth mentions that the pride parade was inspiring and made Caroline proud, while the concert was described as amazing with a lot of love and support. This suggests the prediction is somewhat correct but lacks detail. However, since the ground truth explicitly states that the concert was amazing, we can consider it correct in terms of emotional impact. Step 2/3: Blaming - Since the prediction aligns with the ground truth, the blame lies with the QUESTIONER for asking a question that required more specific details. Step 4: Strategy - The strategy should focus on making the Questioner ask more detailed and discriminative questions.

2026-01-06 14:51:33,239 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction is incorrect because the pride parade influenced Caroline's feelings towards her art differently than stated in the ground truth. The prediction focuses on a personal journey and a specific painting, while the ground truth talks about the influence on her advocacy work and the LGBTQ+ community. Step 2/3: Analyzing causality, the Builder Log shows that Caroline created a painting after attending the pride parade, but it does not mention the specific influence on her art related to the pride parade. Therefore, the blame lies with the BUILDER. Step 4: Formulating strategy, we need to ensure that the Builder captures the relationship between the pride parade and Caroline's art more accurately.

The prediction states that Caroline received support from the adoption advice group at the adoption agency on 2023-08-23, while the ground truth indicates she received encouragement and advice from the group members. This is incorrect. Step 2/3: Analyzing the causality, we see that the specific relationship needed to answer the question (the type of support received from the group) is absent from the Builder Log. The log mentions the group but does not specify the nature of the support provided. Therefore, the blame lies with the BUILDER. Step 4: Formulating the strategy, we need to ensure that the Builder captures the specific details of the support received from the group.

The prediction suggests that Caroline's love for horses might influence her parenting style by fostering empathy, patience, and nurturing. However, the ground truth states that her love for horses is not explicitly stated and is inferred based on her joy and connection with animals. The prediction is plausible but not directly supported by the text buffer. Since the prediction is not incorrect, we move to Step 2/3: Blaming. The Builder Log shows that there are links related to animals and pets, but none specifically mention Caroline's love for horses. Therefore, the blame lies with the BUILDER for not capturing this relevant information.

2026-01-06 14:52:59,320 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction provides specific details about support systems that Caroline has mentioned, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the prediction includes elements that are not explicitly mentioned in the text buffer, such as attending an LGBTQ support group, participating in an LGBTQ pride parade, organizing an LGBTQ art show, volunteering at an LGBTQ+ youth center, and joining a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth. These details are plausible but not directly stated in the conversation. Given that the ground truth mentions support from friends, family, and mentors, as well as the LGBTQ+ community, the prediction is somewhat correct but lacks precision. Since the prediction is plausible and the ground truth is broad, we can consider it correct in the context of the rules provided. However, the question asked is quite specific, and the prediction could be more aligned with the actual conversation. Therefore, we will blame the QUESTIONER for asking a question that requires more specificity and detail.

This will help the system focus on the relevant details and provide more accurate answers.
2026-01-06 14:52:59,579 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction is incorrect because the ground truth specifies that the experience at the café brought joy and showed the beauty of life, and 'thoughtful signs' refer to the inclusive and supportive atmosphere created by the café. The prediction, however, focuses on Caroline's support system and her involvement in the LGBTQ+ community, which is not directly related to the café experience. Step 2/3: Blaming - The blame lies with the BUILDER because the relevant information about the café experience and its impact on Caroline's relationships is missing from the log.

2026-01-06 14:53:37,201 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction is correct and plausible based on the context provided. However, the ground truth specifically mentions bonding over stories, campfires, and nature during a camping trip, which is not explicitly detailed in the prediction. Step 2/3: Blaming - Since the prediction is correct and plausible, the blame lies with the QUESTIONER for not asking a more specific and discriminative question. Step 4: Strategy - The strategy here is to generate a meta-gradient that will encourage the Questioner to ask more detailed and context-specific questions.

2026-01-06 14:53:37,201 - Amadeus.Agent - INFO - 📈 Guideline Updated for [GENERATE]: The Questioner should ask more detailed and context-specific questions to elicit specific activities and experiences that led to bonding. For example, 'Can you describe the specific activities you and Melanie engaged in during your recent camping trip that helped you bond?' This will help the system capture and retrieve more precise information.
2026-01-06 14:53:37,945 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction is quite detailed and plausible, aligning well with the ground truth. However, the ground truth is more concise and doesn't delve into the specifics of nature and camping. Step 2: Given the detailed and plausible nature of the prediction, we need to analyze causality. The builder log shows that both the accident and the camping trip are linked to positive feelings and support within the family. The prediction seems to capture these sentiments accurately. Step 3: Since the prediction is correct, we blame the QUESTIONER for asking a question that requires more context and detail than the current buffer provides. Step 4: Formulate strategy to make the question more discriminative and specific.

2026-01-06 14:53:38,054 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction is overly detailed and includes elements not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth states that the accident made Melanie realize the importance of family and her children provided reassurance and support. The prediction adds details like spending quality time together through camping trips, which are not mentioned in the ground truth. This makes the prediction incorrect in terms of detail but correct in the core idea of family support and resilience. However, since the core idea aligns with the ground truth, we need to analyze further to determine the blame.

Additionally, the prediction states that her emotional state was one of readiness and courage, which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. However, the ground truth does mention her excitement and gratitude, which aligns with a positive emotional state.
