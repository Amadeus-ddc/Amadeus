2026-01-05 15:43:24,879 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Pre: Evan's Prius breaking down might not have a direct effect on his decision to try yoga, but it could be part of a broader context of stress and health concerns. Given that Evan had a health scare last week due to a sudden heart palpitation incident, and realized the importance of health and started a new diet and exercise routine, the breakdown of his car could add to his stress levels, potentially influencing his decision to incorporate yoga as a way to manage stress and improve his overall well-being.
