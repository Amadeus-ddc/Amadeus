2026-01-06 15:25:07,803 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction is incorrect because the ground truth states that Caroline feels the adoption agency is inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+ folks, while the prediction mentions a support group and an agency known for inclusivity and support in LGBTQ+ adoption. This discrepancy suggests that the prediction is plausible but not directly aligned with the ground truth. Step 2/3: Analyzing causality, the Builder Log shows that the necessary information about Caroline's feelings towards the adoption agency is present.

However, the ground truth indicates that Caroline is researching adoption agencies, while Melanie is excited about summer camping plans with her family. This suggests that the prediction is incorrect. Step 2/3: Analyzing Causality - Looking at the Builder Log, we see that Melanie's future plans include camping, but there is no direct link to Caroline's future plans. The log does not mention any discussion between them about future plans. Therefore, the blame lies with the BUILDER for not capturing the interaction or discussion about future plans.

However, the prediction lacks the specific reason given in the ground truth, which is that she was inspired by a recent LGBTQ+ counseling workshop. Step 2/3: Blaming. Since the prediction is correct but incomplete, we need to determine if the information was available in the log. The log shows that the Builder has captured the fact that Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop, which implies her interest in working with trans people.

The prediction is quite detailed and plausible, but it does not align exactly with the ground truth. The ground truth states that Melanie likely felt proud and supportive of Caroline's progress and authenticity. The prediction suggests that Melanie felt inspired, supported, and encouraged, which is close but not entirely aligned. Given the context, the prediction is plausible but not entirely correct. Therefore, we need to analyze the causality further. Step 2/3: Analyzing the Builder Log. The log shows that Melanie's activities and relationships are well-documented, but there is no direct link to her feelings or reactions to Caroline's artwork and journey. The log does not capture the specific emotional response of Melanie to Caroline's story. Step 4: Formulating Strategy. Since the prediction is close but not entirely correct, and the log does not provide the necessary information, we need to improve the system's ability to infer emotional responses based on contextual clues.

2026-01-06 15:28:17,969 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth. The prediction is correct in stating that Melanie mentioned her son got into an accident during a road trip, but is okay. However, the ground truth states that Melanie said the accident was a reminder that life is precious and to cherish her family. This suggests that the prediction is partially correct but misses the deeper sentiment expressed by Melanie. Step 2/3: Blaming QUESTIONER. The question does not capture the deeper sentiment expressed by Melanie. Step 4: Strategy - The Questioner should ask more discriminative questions that probe for emotional or reflective statements.

2026-01-06 15:28:18,275 - Amadeus.Optimizer - INFO - Optimizer CoT: Step 1: Comparing Prediction vs Ground Truth - The prediction states that Melanie's son was okay during the accident and that Melanie reassured him afterward. This aligns with the ground truth, which states that Melanie's son was scared and they reassured him. However, the prediction does not capture the emotional state of the son or the reassurance explicitly. Step 2/3: Blaming - Since the prediction is correct in terms of the factual content, the blame lies with the QUESTIONER for not asking a more detailed question that would elicit the specific reaction and reassurance. Step 4: Strategy - The strategy here is to generate a textual gradient that encourages the QUESTIONER to ask more detailed and discriminative questions.
